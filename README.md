# Multi-objective-Community-Detection
Multi-objective community detection is a computational method that aims to identify communities or clusters within a network while considering multiple objectives simultaneously. Unlike traditional community detection algorithms that optimize a single objective, multi-objective approaches take into account conflicting objectives and strive to find a set of solutions that represent a trade-off among these objectives. By exploring the solution space and evaluating the quality of detected communities, multi-objective community detection offers a more nuanced understanding of complex networks and facilitates decision-making in various disciplines.
